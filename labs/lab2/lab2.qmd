## Introduction & Learning Objectives
<!-- Brief (e.g., 3-5 sentence) description of the main goals of the assignment and what was done. -->
In Lab 2, I implemented a time-multiplexing scheme to drive two seven-segment displays with a single set of FPGA I/O pins. These displayed two independent hexadecimal numbers read from seperate DIP switches and was driven by a single seven-segment decoder HDL module. I also displayed the sum of the numbers on five LEDs. In doing so, I practiced application of transistors and modular verilog.

More information on the lab requirements can be found on the [E155 Lab 2 Course Page](https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab2/).

## Design 
<!-- Explanation of design approach. How did you go about designing and implementing the design? -->
To implement this lab, I had to consider: How should I organize this module in Verilod? How fast should I switch between displays? What transistor type should I use? How do I trigger the transistor? Should I use an anode or cathode display? What resisitor values should I use to protect the FPGA? And so on. 

To work my way through these questions, I drew a block diagram. Essentially I pass through two 4 bit signals from the two DIP switches. I then use the on-board high-speed oscillator to act as an selector signal into a 2-to-1 mux that will select a input signal to pass through the single seven-segment decoder HDL module. I then send the decoded signal to both seven-segment cathod displays. I then utilized the selector signal to drive transistors to trigger each display when needed. By using an NPN transistor, I was able to ensure that the current draw/sink on all FPGA pins are below the currents specified in the recommended operating conditions.

The source code for the project can be found in the associated [Github repository](https://github.com/vparizot/e155-lab2).

## Testing
To verify that the design would work as expected, I ran simulations on ModelSim. To do, I instantiated a test bench that would XXXX.

I also tested the outputs of the summing LEDs to ensure that they correctly summed the values of the two DIP switches in binary.


## Implementation
After confirming that my design would work in simulation, it was time to wire everything up based on the following circuit schematic.

Through trial and error, a suitable switching speed was found so that both sides of the display look like they are on!

 
## Conclusion
<!-- Number of hours spent working on the lab are included. -->

<!-- Statement of whether the design meets all the requirements. If not, list the shortcomings.-->
Lab 2 provided an introduction to implementing multiplexing in a visual manner. As a result, I grew more familiar with the different type of transistors and calculations for current draw. 

Lab 2 meets all the requirements, and took me approximately 9 hours.
