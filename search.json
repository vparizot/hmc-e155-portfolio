This involved sodering both surface mount technology (SMT) and through hole technology (THT) components, based on the provided BOM.\n\n\n\nCompleted E155 Development Board\n\n\nAfter soldering, it was time to power up and test the board. To do so, I programmed the FPGA using Lattice Radiant and Segger Embedded Studio to toggle LED pins at predetermined frequencies. After confirming my board worked as expected, it was time to implement LEDs and the 7 segment display."

    "text": "Design & Implementation\n\n\nLab Requirements\nThe next step was to program three LEDs and a seven segment display. The seven segment display is to read four DIP switch signals, s, as a 4 bit binary value and display that value in hexidecimal. The behavior of the LEDs are described by the following tables.\n\n\n\n\nSignal Name\n\n\nSignal Type\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclk\n\n\ninput\n\n\n48 MHz clock on FPGA\n\n\n\n\ns[3:0]\n\n\ninput\n\n\nthe four DIP switches (on the board, SW6)\n\n\n\n\nled[2:0]\n\n\noutput\n\n\n3 LEDs (you may use the on-board LEDs)\n\n\n\n\nseg[6:0]\n\n\noutput\n\n\nthe segments of a common-anode 7-segment display\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following tables define the relationship of the LEDs to the switches and clock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS1\n\n\nS0\n\n\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\nON\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\nON\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS3\n\n\nS2\n\n\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\nOFF\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\nON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nled[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlink at 2.4 Hz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nTo organize my thoughts I used a block diagram to map the logic.\n\n\n\nLab 1 Block Diagram\n\n\n\nLed Logic Design\nThe truth tables revealed that led[0] behaves as an XOR gate with inputs S1 and S0 and that led[1] behaves as an AND gate with inputs S3 and S2.\nTo have led[2] to blink at 2.4 Hz, I utilized the internal 48 gHz high speed oscillator from the HSOSC Library. A frequency of 2.4 Hz would have a full cycle of 0.4167 second. Dividing this by the frequency of the internal oscillator, we get that a full cycle would require 2*10^7 ticks. To achieve a duty cycle of 50%, I implemented a flip flop that switched led[2] every 10^7 clicks.\n\n\nSeven Segment Logic Design\nTo interface the seven segment display with the board, I conferred with the datasheet to determine resistor values. \n\n\n\nResistor Calculations for Seven Segment Display\n\n\nI opted to use resistor values of 240 ohms, producing 6.25 mA of current.\nA wiring schematic is shown below. \nHere is a photo of the implemented design!"
