    "text": "Soldering and Circuitry\nThe first step was to assemble the custom printed circuit board which hosts the MCU and FPGA boards. This involved sodering both THT and SMT components, based on the provided BOM. \nAfter soldering, it was time to power up and test the board. To do so, I programmed the FPGA using Lattice Radiant and Segger Embedded Studio to toggle LED pins at predetermined frequencies. After confirming my board worked as expected, it was time to implement the 7 segment display."
